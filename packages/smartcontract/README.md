## Prerequisites

* Node: `>=10.15.5 <12.0.0`
* Yarn: `>=1.0.0`

## Install Dependencies

_If you have already done this in the root level of this monorepo, you can skip this step._

```
yarn install
```

## Build

```sh
yarn build
```

## Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn deploy [--network <network>]
```
Currently the only available values for network are:

- `local`: local `ganache-cli` running on port `8545`
- `development`: development `ganache-cli` (run it with `yarn ganache-dev`)
- `rinkeby`: Rinkeby test network

**IMPORTANT:** To use this smart contract, you need to at least deploy it to `local` or `development`.
